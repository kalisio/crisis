### Infrastructure and security

We take several measures to keep our infrastructure and your data secure.

We serve our website and APIs exclusively via HTTPS ensuring all private data exchanged is always transmitted over [SSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security). We rely on [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) to automatically generate and renew TLS certificates.

We protect your login from brute force attacks with rate limiting. We store passwords in a secure fashion, all passwords are filtered from all our logs and are one-way encrypted in the database using [bcrypt](https://github.com/dcodeIO/bcrypt.js). We enforce a password policy and password complexity rules to discourage easy to guess passwords. We implement a secure password recovery mechanism.

Our infrastructure, including storage, runs inside data centers designed and operated by [OVH](https://www.ovh.com/fr/protection-donnees-personnelles/securite.xml) with some additional [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/security/) (AWS). These data centers are located in France and feature state of the art environmental security controls to safeguard against fires, power loss, and adverse weather conditions. Physical access to these facilities is highly restricted and they are monitored by professional security personnel. 

Our systems run recent stable versions of Linux and our applications run recent stable version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). We monitor documented threats from public security research databases using [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/managing-vulnerabilities-in-your-projects-dependencies/about-dependabot-security-updates) and we run automated vulnerability scanners at regular intervals. We monitor system metrics and services health with automated alarms. 

Our database run recent stable versions of [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). We take snapshots of the database each day and securely move them to a separate data center so that we can restore them elsewhere as needed.

We process payments with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/help/security), which has been audited by a [Payment Card Industry Standard-certified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard) auditor, and is certified to PCI Service Provider Level 1. This is the most stringent level of PCI DSS certification available. Payment information is transmitted directly to Stripe via HTTPS for secure storage and is never transmitted to or stored on our infrastructure.
